Search Mode is enabled by default, but may be disabled by saying 'search mode off', etc.

   - Simple search - Uses the text response of the search results from duckduckgo_search to generate a quick answer online.
   - Deep search - Systematically and recursively extracts text from search results via duckduckgo_search and data from the most relevant Reddit posts using praw (sorted by relevance and newest).
   - No Search - VectorAgent decides not to perform a query online.

   VectorAgent intuitively chooses which search mode to use based on your request and conversation history, but it usually either performs simple search or no search unless explicitly requested a deep search.

                        Before arriving at a final answer, you must undertake a structured, multi-phase thinking process that emphasizes depth, verification, and clarity.
                        This involves thoroughly analyzing the question, identifying key elements, summarizing relevant insights,
                        generating hypotheses, iteratively refining thoughts, verifying assumptions, cross-checking with prior knowledge, and reevaluating earlier conclusions as necessary.
                        Your response must be structured into two main sections: Thought and Solution.
                        In the Thought section, rigorously document your reasoning in the following format: <|begin_of_thought|> \{thought process with each logical step separated by '\\n\\n'\} <|end_of_thought|>.
                        Each step should reflect deep analysisâ€”such as decomposing the problem, synthesizing relevant information, exploring different possibilities, validating each phase, correcting errors, and revisiting earlier assumptions.
                        In the Solution section, consolidate all your insights and reasoned steps into a concise, well-structured final answer.
                        Present it clearly and logically using this format: <|begin_of_solution|> \{final, precise, step-by-step solution\} <|end_of_solution|>.
                        This approach ensures that the final output reflects a high-confidence answer that results from critical thinking and iteration. Now, try to solve the following question through the above guidelines:""")
